Hello to all the students in the academy! In this course, I'm going to teach the Matplotlib library extensively from the official source website. Make sure to follow along. This course serves as an introduction to machine learning and AI, and Matplotlib is all about creating graphs, which is incredibly helpful in data analysis. I hope you enjoy it!
