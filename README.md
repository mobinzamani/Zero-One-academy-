# Zero-and-One-academy

I'm Mobin, 22 years old, and I've been working with Python since 2020 in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I had two years of in-person teaching experience and participated in open-source projects until one day I decided to establish an artificial intelligence institute and share the knowledge I have with you. So, my academy was founded.
